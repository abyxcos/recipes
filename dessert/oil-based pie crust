3 cups flour
1 tsp salt
6 1/2 oz oil
3 1/2 oz milk

Place the flour and the salt in a bowl.
Measure the oil and milk together and add to flour mixture.
Mix until just combined. (For a firmer, less flaky crust, knead for 3-5 minutes. For a fruit pie, knead the bottom crust.)
Cut in half and roll each half between waxed paper for a two-crust pie.
