Pastry for 2-crust pie
3/4 cup sugar (1/2 packed brown sugar, 1/2 white granulated sugar)
1/4 cup flour
1 tsp cinnamon (heaping)
1/8 tsp nutmeg
1/4 tsp salt
7 cups thinly sliced, pared tart cooking apples (2 1/2 lbs) [mix of apples, always including 2x granny smith, also pack in about 8 cups]
1 tblsp fresh lemmon juice
2 tblsp butter/margarine [normally leave out the butter]

1. Make pie dough according to directions, line 9'' pie pan with bottom crust. Refrigerate.
2. Preheat oven to 425F.
3. In a small bowl, mix sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt.
4. In a large bowl, toss apples with lemon juice.
5. Add sugar mixture to sliced apples; toss lightly to combine.
6. Roll out crust top.
7. Turn apple mixture into pie pan, mounding up in center.
8. OPTIONAL -- dot apples with butter.
9. Put crust top on top of apples.
10. Finish off as you would a double-crust pie, crimping edges tightly.
11. Bake 45-50 minutes until apples are tender and crust is golden. (The apples are usually juicy, I pour off and excess juices to keep the bottom from getting soggy.)
12. Serve warm or cold. ENJOY!
